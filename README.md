# Healthspan
First step in the attempt of extending Morocco's healthspan.
This is my first time in Git. This is my second time trying code.

# Context
I'm a pharmacist. This project is part of a larger projet. Which is my life's mission. The mission is to extend Moroccan people's healthspans. I will accomplish this mission by making primary healthcare in Morocco evidence based, and enjoyable. This Git focuses on the "make it enoyable" bit. I will deal with the "make it evidence based" bit elsewhere in my life.

# The porject
This project consists of building an app that can be run in browser. The app will be used by pharmacists or pharmacy staff to optimise their inventory levels. The app will take sales data as an input, and return optimal stock level as an output. The server side (backend) will use Python for logic and SQL for storing data.
